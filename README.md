# Gloobit

third-party libraries:
* GLAD
* GLFW

Trying to make a simple wrapper/API for OpenGL to reduce clutter in files.

# TODOs

* add a better way to store vertex arrays
** also add methods for setting and disabling layouts (attributes)
* figure out a better way to store drawables
** figure out how to edit drawables position/rotation/etc. in a reasonable manner
